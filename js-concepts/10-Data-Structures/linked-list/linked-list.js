/**
 * Operations supported by the linked-list:
 * 1. add
 * 2. delete
 * 3. clear
 * 4. has
 * 5. front
 * 6. next
 * 7. length
 * 
 * Features:
 * 1. Each node is represented as:
 *  --------
 *  | next |
 *  --------
 *  | data |
 *  |      |
 *  --------  
 * 2. Traversal = O(n) so time to find a node not predictable
 * 3. Efficient to remove nodes from the middle of the array
 * 4. JavaScript arrays have same benefits as that of a linked-list as they are 
 * implemented as objects
 * 5. A single node is allocated at a time as and when required.
