/*
You've just discovered some peculiar behavior in JavaScript. Itâ€™s called implicit type coercion 
and it's a feature of JavaScript. JavaScript multiplies the 5*10 to become 50 and then changes 
the number 50 into the string "50", so you're adding together the same data type. This then gets 
combined with the string "Hello"
*/

/*
null refers to the "value of nothing", while undefined refers to the "absence of value".

/*
falsy values > false, 0, "", null, undefined, and NaN
