 * Template literals are essentially string literals that include embedded expressions.
 * Denoted with backticks ( `` ) instead of single quotes ( '' ) or double quotes ( "" ),
 * template literals can contain placeholders which are represented using ${expression}.
 * This makes it much easier to build strings.
