# JavaScript General Knowledge

## Introduction to JS
__JavaScriptÂ®__ (often shortened to __JS__) is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with _first-class_ functions, and is best known as the scripting language for Web pages, but it's used in many non-browser environments as well. It is a _prototype-based_, multi-paradigm scripting language that is dynamic, and supports _object-oriented_, _imperative_, and _functional programming_ styles.

## First-class Function
A programming language is said to have _First-class_ functions when functions in that language are treated like any other variable. For example, in such a language, a function can be passed as an argument to other functions, can be returned by another function and can be assigned as a value to a variable.
