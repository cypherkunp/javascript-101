## Data types
### The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:
* These are six data types that are primitives in JS:
1. Boolean
2. Null
3. Undefined
4. Number
5. String
6. Symbol (new in ECMAScript 6)
* and Object

### Implicit type coercion 
- It's a feature of JavaScript. JavaScript multiplies the 5* 10 to become 50 and then changes 
the number 50 into the string "50", so you're adding together the same data type. This then gets 
combined with the string "Hello"

### null
- _null_ refers to the "value of nothing".

### undefined
- _undefined_ refers to the "absence of value".

### falsy values 
- false, 0, "", null, undefined, and NaN
