# JavaScript Concepts

## Data types

The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:

1. Boolean
2. Null
3. Undefined
4. Number
5. String
6. Symbol (new in ECMAScript 6)
* and Object


* null > _null_ refers to the "value of nothing".
* undefined > _undefined_ refers to the "absence of value".
* falsy values > false, 0, "", null, undefined, and NaN

## Arrays

The difference Between Arrays and Objects:

* In JavaScript, arrays use numbered indexes.  
* In JavaScript, objects use named indexes.

When to use Arrays and when to use Objects:

* JavaScript does not support associative arrays.
* Use objects when you want the element names to be strings (text).
* You should use arrays when you want the element names to be numbers.
